      Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

      Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
      Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
      Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"
      A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

      Break the program down into simple, individual behaviors with input/output examples. Begin with the simplest possible behavior. List these behaviors (also known as "specs" or "specifications") in the project's README.md file.
